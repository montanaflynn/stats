## Introduction

The stats package provides various functions for sampling and estimation, allowing developers to work with both population and sample data. These tools are essential for statistical analysis, data science, and machine learning applications.

## Sampling

The package offers two main functions for sampling: `Sample` and `StableSample`.

### Sample Function

The `Sample` function allows you to take a random sample from a given dataset, with or without replacement.

```go
func Sample(input Float64Data, takenum int, replacement bool) ([]float64, error)
```

Parameters:
- `input`: The input dataset (Float64Data)
- `takenum`: The number of samples to take
- `replacement`: Whether to sample with replacement (true) or without replacement (false)

Example usage:

```go
data := stats.Float64Data{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
sample, err := stats.Sample(data, 3, false)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
fmt.Println(sample)
// Possible output: [2, 5, 3]
```

### StableSample Function

The `StableSample` function returns samples from the input while maintaining the order of the original data.

```go
func StableSample(input Float64Data, takenum int) ([]float64, error)
```

Parameters:
- `input`: The input dataset (Float64Data)
- `takenum`: The number of samples to take

Example usage:

```go
data := stats.Float64Data{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
sample, err := stats.StableSample(data, 3)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}
fmt.Println(sample)
// Possible output: [1, 3, 5]
```

## Population vs. Sample Statistics

The stats package provides functions for both population and sample statistics. The main difference is that sample statistics are used when working with a subset of the entire population and adjust for bias in the calculations.

### Variance

The package offers functions for both population and sample variance:

```go
func PopulationVariance(input Float64Data) (pvar float64, err error)
func SampleVariance(input Float64Data) (svar float64, err error)
```

Example usage:

```go
data := stats.Float64Data{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
popVar, _ := stats.PopulationVariance(data)
sampleVar, _ := stats.SampleVariance(data)
fmt.Printf("Population Variance: %.2f\n", popVar)
fmt.Printf("Sample Variance: %.2f\n", sampleVar)
// Output:
// Population Variance: 2.00
// Sample Variance: 2.50
```

### Standard Deviation

Similarly, the package provides functions for population and sample standard deviation:

```go
func StandardDeviationPopulation(input Float64Data) (float64, error)
func StandardDeviationSample(input Float64Data) (float64, error)
```

Example usage:

```go
data := stats.Float64Data{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
popStdDev, _ := stats.StandardDeviationPopulation(data)
sampleStdDev, _ := stats.StandardDeviationSample(data)
fmt.Printf("Population Standard Deviation: %.4f\n", popStdDev)
fmt.Printf("Sample Standard Deviation: %.4f\n", sampleStdDev)
// Output:
// Population Standard Deviation: 1.4142
// Sample Standard Deviation: 1.5811
```

## Other Estimation Functions

The stats package includes several other functions for estimation and statistical analysis:

- `Mean`: Calculate the arithmetic mean of a dataset
- `Median`: Calculate the median value of a dataset
- `Mode`: Find the mode (most frequent value(s)) in a dataset
- `Percentile`: Calculate the percentile of a dataset
- `Quartile`: Calculate the quartiles of a dataset
- `InterQuartileRange`: Calculate the interquartile range of a dataset

## When to Use Population vs. Sample Statistics

- Use population statistics when you have data for the entire population or when making inferences about the specific group of data you're analyzing.
- Use sample statistics when you're working with a subset of a larger population and want to make inferences about the entire population based on your sample.

In general, if you're unsure whether your data represents the entire population or just a sample, it's often safer to use sample statistics, as they account for potential bias in the sampling process.

Remember that the choice between population and sample statistics can significantly impact your results, especially with smaller datasets. Always consider the context of your data and the goals of your analysis when deciding which approach to use.
